# Remaining defects — to be worked at the very end

Everything here was found by rendering the .docx through LibreOffice and comparing it against the
source PDF page by page, in batches of 20 over the 80-document corpus. Each entry names the batch,
the document, what is wrong, and what was already tried.

Work through this only after the other corpora are processed.

---

## A. Multi-column pages still overflow to a second sheet — 3 documents

Fixed this pass: 63, 67, 78, 80 and 55 now render 1 page against 1 (they were 2). Sections now carry
`w:cols w:num` from the engine's own column bands, with a section break when the column count
changes. These three did not follow:

| Doc | Batch | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| **64_newspaper_uneven_columns_ad_boxes** | 4 | Uneven columns plus three ad boxes; still 2 pages. The ad boxes are drawn but stack below the body. |
| **65_two_col_full_width_figure_caption** | 4 | A full-width figure spanning both columns; the chart renders but the spanning band is not modelled, so the flow breaks into two pages. |
| **77_arabic_rtl_document** | 4 | The description column collapses to a sliver: `colX` is [57,152,246,340,434,528] while `cellR` for the description column reports 428.2, so the writer wraps the cell into a 17 pt column. RTL column widths are not honoured. |

## B. Table geometry — 3 documents

| Doc | Batch | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| **75_merged_header_cell_three_columns** | 4 | The first data row welds into the header ("Services1,842"). The page's sub-header rule at y=143 spans only part of the width, so no band boundary is found and header + value land in one cell. |
| **80_gstin_pan_cin_ifsc_table** | 4 | The four-column dealer grid collapses to two panels. Page count is now correct; the panel split is not. |
| **28_value_overflows_cell** | 2 | A value wider than its column is handled, but not with the page's own overflow behaviour. |

## C. Vertical position — every document, small offsets

Horizontal position is 0.1 pt everywhere, measured by rendering both sides and matching lines by
text. Vertical is not: 93 % of lines land within 10 pt on 21 and 79, 59 % on 01, and lower on the
table-heavy documents.

Causes still open:
- **Table TOP y** is flow-determined, not the PDF's y. Rows are the right height but the table can
  start a little high or low, moving everything below it.
- **Table row pitch** is slightly compact against the page on several invoices.
- **Page-anchored shapes drift** against the more compact text flow — 48's green border box starts
  below "Father's/husband's name" and its bottom edge cuts through "K. Ramesh, Clerk"; 79's rules
  and pink header band no longer line up with the rows.
- **Stamps sit a few points off** their PDF position. A rotated box cannot carry a rotation that
  LibreOffice honours (`a:xfrm rot` is ignored, `wps:bodyPr vert` lays Latin out one character per
  row), so the box is axis-aligned at the line's origin.

## D. Individual documents

| Doc | Batch | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| **30_mixed_font_sizes_one_baseline** | 2 | Renders 2 pages against 1. Its flow is longer than the sheet. |
| **26_footnote_marker_bottom_note** | 2 | The footnote marker's position relative to its note is close but not exact. |
| **52_one_cm_margin_wide_body** | 3 | The body does not justify across the full 28.3 pt margin the page uses. |
| **58_header_rule_footer_rule** | 3 | The rules render but do not sit exactly on the page's y. |
| **59_landscape_mixed_portrait** | 3 | The section break survives and the page is landscape, but the content is slightly compact. |
| **03_stamp_vertical_90deg** | 1 | LibreOffice truncates the 90-degree rotated stamp boxes in the render. |

## What is NOT on this list, and should not come back

Verified across all 80 documents:
- no black page — every .docx declares `<w:background w:color="FFFFFF"/>`
- no lost text — the gate reports 0 missing across the corpus for the batches it covers
- no missing image — every PDF page that draws an image has it in `word/media/`
- no scrambled layout — body text flows as real paragraphs, tables are real `w:tbl`
- no floating text boxes except for genuinely rotated lines
- no heading autospacing stacking on explicit spacing
- no `w:trHeight` missing, so tables no longer collapse to text height
